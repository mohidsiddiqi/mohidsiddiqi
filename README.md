# 👋 Hi, I’m Mohid Siddiqi

**Senior Full-Stack Developer | Security-First Systems | Infrastructure Automation**

I build secure, scalable cloud platforms end-to-end — from architecture and backend APIs to modern UIs and production deployments. My focus areas are **PCI-DSS aligned access control (RBAC/MFA), infrastructure automation (Nutanix Prism, Cisco FMC), and legacy modernization** backed by clean code and strong DevOps habits. I’ve delivered both **greenfield** products and **large modernization programs**, and I mentor teams to raise the bar.

## 📌 Projects & Contributions

### 🔒 Enterprise Security & Compliance
- **RBAC for Admin Portal** — Fine-grained module/page/action permissions, group profiles, and a CMT management UI; aligned to PCI-DSS.
- **Duo MFA across logins** — Push/SMS/Phone with a one-minute selection window, robust timeout/deny handling.
- **Inactive User Self-Reactivation** — PCI 90-day lockout → email passcode (5-min TTL) → secure reset; removed manual support loops.
- **Validation Framework Rebuild** — Replaced brittle custom JS with **ParsleyJS** across four security modules; restored critical workflows.
- **Activity Logging** — Who/what/when/outcome/reason surfaced via optimized tables for auditability.

### ⚙️ Infrastructure Automation
- **Nutanix v2 → v3 transition (Prism Central)** — Modular Python wrappers and hybrid fallback; replication and multi-cluster readiness.
- **Cisco FMC automation** — Port lifecycle (NAT + ACL), enable/disable via ACL action, and **S2S VPN** creation/edit/tunnels with safe deploys.
- **Register VM enhancement (solo)** — Added **registered-VM migration** between accounts with same-DC and pricing-parity checks; automated order/billing updates; removed risky manual DB edits.
- **VM ↔ Product Slider mismatch guardrails** — Frontend blockers + daily backend scan/email reports by cluster to prevent silent “downgrades”.

### 🌿 Healthcare SaaS
- Contributed to a **multi-tenant EMR, lab reporting, and appointment** platform used across hospitals and diagnostic labs.
- Built **secure REST APIs** (interoperability, SMS/device integrations) and **ReactJS/Redux dashboards** for clinician-grade UX.
- Applied **SOLID/OOP/MVC** and Agile delivery (Git/Jira) to land features that matched real clinical workflows and compliance needs.

### 🧢 Full-Stack Delivery & Leadership
- Shipped **10+ full web apps** (Laravel, ReactJS, modern JS) for international clients under tight, changing specs.
- Owned **end-to-end SDLC**: requirements, estimates, architecture, backend, frontend, integrations (**PayPal/Stripe/Zoom/Maps/YouTube**), demos, deployment, and maintenance.
- **Legacy rescues** across unfamiliar stacks (Node.js, Magento, Babylon.js/Three.js) with minimal docs; kept production stable.
- Mentored **4+** juniors; task delegation, code reviews, and onboarding.

### 🛠️ DevOps & Reliability
- **CentOS 7 → RHEL/Rocky migration (24 servers overall; I led 4 critical)** — Dockerized Django apps, schedulers, VNC/noVNC; **zero-downtime** cutover with blue-green strategy.
- **Dockerization of Cloud Manager** — Local/stage/prod compose stacks, SSL via Apache reverse proxy on RHEL 9; resolved cross-platform issues.
- **Django 3.2 → 4.2** upgrades across **5–7 repositories** — standardized process/docs, removed unused packages, fixed deprecations; staged rollouts.
- **Critical hotfixes** — Fast RCA and safe releases across FE/BE/daemon to stabilize production.

## 🏆 Selected Achievements
- Refactored **25+ Django modules** for clarity, performance, and maintainability.  
- Led **hybrid Nutanix v2→v3** wrappers and multi-cluster readiness via Prism Central.  
- Designed **RBAC + Duo MFA + audit trails** to meet PCI-DSS expectations.  
- Delivered **10+ apps** and mentored a team while running full SDLC in a startup context.  
- Migrated **4** mission-critical servers as part of a **24-server** zero-downtime OS upgrade.

## 🚧 Personal Projects
- **FinGuard AI (WIP)** — FastAPI-based personal finance tracker MVP with lightweight AI insights and a full SDLC approach.  
- **Supervisor Finder (FYP)** — Custom **PHP MVC** platform matching MS/PhD students with supervisors worldwide (verified accounts, proposals, triage, messaging); I authored the documentation and delivered the whole SDLC.
